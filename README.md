# Orange PI Zero 3 - Aarch Linux / Ubuntu 

ANSI C terminal programs for the "orange pi zero 3" running Arch Linux. 
In this era of user-friendly, one-size-fits-all operating systems, Arch Linux stands as a beacon of choice, flexibility, and simplicity. 

It is a distribution that does not hold your hand, but rather empowers you to sculpt your digital world to your exact specifications. 
With Arch Linux, you are the architect of your computing experience, and this freedom is both its beauty and its challenge.

The Orange Pi Zero is a small single-board computer (SBC) developed by the Shenzhen Xunlong Software Co., Ltd. 
It is part of the Orange Pi family of SBCs, which are similar in concept to the popular Raspberry Pi. 
The Orange Pi Zero is designed for various embedded and DIY projects and is known for its affordability and compact size.
Here are some key features and specifications of the Orange Pi Zero:

Processor: 
The Orange Pi Zero typically comes with an Allwinner H2 system-on-chip (SoC) which includes a quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU.

Memory: 
It usually has 512MB of DDR3 RAM, although there may be variants with different memory configurations.

Storage: 
There is a microSD card slot for storage, where you can install the operating system and store data.

Connectivity: 
The board includes a 10/100 Ethernet port, which is a notable feature for a board of its size and price. 
It also has onboard Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, depending on the variant.

USB Ports: It typically has one USB 2.0 host port and one micro USB OTG port.

GPIO Pins: 
The Orange Pi Zero has a 26-pin GPIO header, similar to the Raspberry Pi, allowing you to connect various sensors, displays, 
and other peripherals.

Video Output: It features an HDMI output for connecting to a monitor or TV.

Audio: There's a 3.5mm audio jack for audio output, and some variants may have onboard microphones.

Operating System: 
It supports various Linux distributions other then Arch, including Armbian / Ubuntu and Raspbian, 
and can be used for a variety of applications such as a low-power server, media center, or IoT device. 
(TESTED) Arch Linux works fully with the WiFi/Bluetooth chip.  Armbian is really buggy works with USB WiFi only! 

Power: The board is powered via a micro USB port.

Size: The Orange Pi Zero is compact and typically comes in the size of a credit card.

It's worth noting that the Orange Pi Zero, like many other single-board computers, has various versions and variants, 
and the specifications may vary slightly between different models. 

It's a popular choice for hobbyists and tinkerers due to its low cost and versatility. 
However, its community and software support might not be as extensive as that of more popular SBCs. 
This is why I started this project. 

So, embark on this journey with an open mind and a sense of curiosity. 
Happy hacking, and welcome to the toolchain zero project.
